### Intro to Pizza API
This is the Pizza API project that I made in my Software Engineering course. In this folder you will find all code files for the Pizza API (in the "api" folder), a Technical Documentation file, a User Manual Documentation file, and a short video demonstration of the Pizza API (as of 12/2/2025). During the course I also worked with a partner in Adam Lupfer and credit for the Pizza API also goes to him. Since completion of the course (12/2/2025) all changes that have been made are mine alone.
