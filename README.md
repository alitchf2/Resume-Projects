### Intro to Resume Projects Repository
This is the repository that I have created to hold the projects that I discuss on my resume. The projects are labeled in thier own folder and have their own README.md's that should help with knowing what they are. Both of these projects were created in as course work at UNC Charlotte and were also made as a group effort. Since submitting each project I have added my own improvements and those improvements are mine alone.
