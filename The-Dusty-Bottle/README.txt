### Intro to The Dusty Bottle
This is "The Dusty Bottle" game that I made in my Intro to Game Design and Development course. In this folder you will find all files for The Dusty Bottle game to be run in the GameMaker engine (GameMaker is where the code for the game was written). During the course I also worked with Thomas Copeland, Christian Schimdt, and Charlie Pearsall and credit for the completion of the game also goes to them. Since the completion of this course (12/4/2025) all changes that have been made are mine alone.

### Game Instructions: 

The dusty bottle is a wild west-themed cowboy bar game where the player is tasked with serving various bar patrons while maintaining the establishment's quality, rowdiness, and morality. There are 2 controls for this game, the first being space, which is occasionally required to advance dialogue, which is prompted by the game. The second is mouse left click, which is used to select which drink the player will use to select which drink they would like to serve.

### Gameplay Walkthrough: 

When you first load up the game, you are greeted with a start menu where you have the options to either start or quit the game. Once the game has begun, the player is first greeted by a landlord who introduces the player to the drink pouring mechanic and provides some backstory. Following this event, a friendly sheriff walks in who informs you about what you can do when an outlaw appears in the bar. After this, the tutorial sequence is over, the player then has to serve a varying number of bar patrons each day in order to earn money to afford rent for the bar, which is collected at the end of the week. Different kinds of npcs that cause different events can enter, such as outlaws, who when you serve them, make your morality bar go down. Alternatively, you can turn them in for a morality boost, but you earn no money. Some drinks can also affect the bar’s rowdiness level depending on their strength, which can require the player to lose money for repair costs. Balancing your status bars and money is key to being successful.

### Tips to succeed:
Keep the rowdiness low to reduce bar fight damages. Best ways to do this include:
* When Arbuckle is available as a drink option, maybe take the quality hit, it’ll sober up patrons
* Only give outlaws “Outlaws Oath”, they can have it with no rowdiness raised, others will be raised dramatically
Keep morality in the middle to reduce fines or robberies. Best ways to do this include:
* Don’t turn in too many outlaws; it’ll raise your morality too fast
* Only turn them in if you’ve given them too many drinks
